The thermodynamic (or equilibrium) properties of the refrigerant largely determine the energy efficiency and capacity of the vapour compression cycle and are thus the key data needed in designing equipment and in comparing one working fluid with another. The transport properties have a major impact on equipment design (particularly of heat exchangers) and thus influence whether it is economically feasible to build a machine which can actually obtain the theoretical efficiency of the thermodynamic cycle. The evaluation of a number of promising new refrigerants has been hampered by the lack of property data. This paper begins to address this problem by compiling, evaluating and correlating key thermodynamic data for selected fluids. Considered are the critical and triple point parameters, vapour pressure, saturated liquid density, ideal gas heat capacity and the single-phase pressurevolume-temperature ( p -V -T ) properties. This paper is the first instalment of what is expected to be a continuing activity; it is not all-inclusive and, indeed, the author would appreciate information on data sources that are *Presented at the 1989ASHRAECFC TechnologyConference,NIST, Gaitbersburg, MD, USA, 27-28 September 1989.

Other important properties, such as surface tension and the transport properties of viscosity and thermal conductivity, will be considered in the future. The fluids considered include the leading candidates to replace the fully halogenated CFCs: R23, R32, R125, R143a, R22, R134a, R152a, R124, R142b and R123. These fluids are all hydrogen-containing halogenated methanes and ethanes. The range of normal boiling points for these candidate fluids is similar to that seen witli the fully halogenated compounds. While other fluids, such as R134, R123a and R141b, and other classes of fluids, such as fluorinated propanes and ethers, show promise as refrigerants, there is insufficient data on these other compounds to warrant\" inclusion in the present work. In many instances, the fluids considered here have never been commercially produced and, as a consequence, the data for many of them are sparse; thus, all possible sources of data have been utilized. These include the published literature (as revealed by a search of Chemical Abstracts and surveys such as that by Stewart et al. compilations such as that by the Japanese Association of Refrigeration2, prepublication versions of manuscripts received from several' groups, and, finally, unpublished data provided by several chemical manufacturers.

R22.", "The extensive body of data on R22 (chlorodifluoromethane) is summarized, evaluated and correlated in the treatise by the Japanese Association of Refrigeration (JAR) 2. The data sources recommended by the JAR were largely adopted here so that the limited time available for this project could be better expended On other fluids for which no such compilations exist. In addition, several works published since 1975 have also been included. The triple point temperature has been measured by Neilson and White 26. ASHRAE 27 reports a value which is 2.7 K (4.9\u00b0F) lower but does not fully document the source, and thus the experimental value of Neilson and White 26 is adopted here. Both the JAR 2 and Kohlen et al. 2s have examined the available critical point data and recommend identical values for the critical parameters; their recommendations are adopted here. The vapour pressure data of Kletskii, Kohlen 2s'29 and Zander 3\u00b0 were fitted in Equation (1); the residuals are shown in Figure 5(a). Zander's point at 366.1 K (199.3\u00b0F) was excluded from the fit because it appeared to be anomalously low compared to the other data sets. tin Figure 5(a) and all similar residual plots, points used in the correlation are shown as filled-in symbols; points excluded from the fit are shown as open symbols. The correlation for saturated liquid density [Equation (2)] was fitted to the data of Zander 3\u00b0, Okada et al. 32 and Kohlen et al. 2s. All three data sets are in excellent agreement below about 350 K (170\u00b0F); above this temperature, the values of Okada et al. 32 and Zander 3\u00b0 diverge. The data of Zander 3\u00b0 were more consistent with the selected critical density and were thus used for the fit at temperatures above 350 K (170\u00b0F). For the ideal gas heat capacity, the values presented in the JANAF tables 11 are the basis for the fit to Equation(3). These are calculated from spectroscopic data and are based on a thorough survey of the literature. The JAR 2 reports that several other calculations of C~ are in essential agreement with the JANAF values. The values of Rodgers 3~ are as much as 2.5% lower than those of JANAF. Such a large discrepancy is unusual for a single-carbon molecule. Ernst and B/Jsser 33 have directly measured the low pressure heat capacity of R22; their values for Cp (obtained by extrapolation to zero pressure) are about 1.5% lower than the values adopted here. Four sources of p -V -T data are indicated in Figure 5(c). The data of Michels (as reported by Martin 34) cover the range below about the critical density. The measurements of Kohlen 2s and Kumagi and Iwasaki 35 are in the liquid density region, with the later data set extending to very high pressures (160MPa, 23200 psia). The most wide-ranging data are those of Zander 3\u00b0, who employed isochoric and Burnett techniques along lines of constant volume and temperature, respectively. Although extensive data are available in the vapour region, there is very little liquid data below 300 K (80\u00b0F) and none below 250 K ( -1 0 \u00b0 F ) . If not for this deficit at low temperatures, R22 might be an excellent reference fluid for developing models for the entire class of polar refrigerants.

In addition, Yamashita et al. 43 have measured the vapour pressure of R134a at 25 temperatures from 253 to 371 K ( -4 to 208\u00b0F); their paper does not, however, give the experimental points.

Four sets of saturated liquid densities have been reported by two independent groups. Wilson and Basu 2\u00b0 report nine measurements over a fairly wide range of temperature (238.9 to 371.6 K, -2 9 . 6 to 209.2\u00b0F) using the floating bead technique. At Keio University, Kabata et al. 44 report six measurements in the vicinity of the critical point, Maezawa et al. 42 have measured 25 densities from 200 to 370 K ( -100 to 206\u00b0F) and Piao et al. 41 have determined seven points by extrapolation of their isochoric p -V T data to the saturation line.

The expression for ideal gas heat capacity [Equation (3)] is based on the values derived by Goodwin and Moldover 45 from their sound speed measurements on the low pressure vapour. The values calculated by Chen et al. and Wilson and Basu 2\u00b0 from spectroscopic data are 1.2-2.7% higher than the values adopted here.

Their measurements include a critical point determination which is in good agreement with the parameters reported by Basu et a l / 4 . The critical temperature and density of Kubota et al. ~ are used here because of their higher stated accuracy. The critical pressure was obtained by extrapolating the vapour pressure data of Basu et al. ~ to the critical temperature. The only information on the triple point temperature was an undocumented value reported on a manufacturer's data sheet ~9. The value of 74 K (-326\u00b0F) seems anomalously low compared to the other ethane based refrigerants, but, if correct, would give R124 the greatest two-phase range of any fluid. Although fairly comprehensive, the measurements of Kubota et al. ~ have two weaknesses. The first is a lower temperature limit of only 278 K (41\u00b0F). The second, more serious, problem is the fairly poor precision of the pressure measurements. An accuracy of 12 kPa (1.7 psia) is claimed for the vapour pressure measurements; this is equivalent to an error of 6% at the lowest temperature. The relative error would be smaller at higher temperatures and pressures, yet for temperatures between 300 and 350K (80 and 170\u00b0F) there are serious discrepancies between the data of Kubota et al. ~ and the vapour pressure points reported by Basu et al. ~4 [see Figure 8(a)]. Because of the wider temperature range of the Basu et a l / 4 data and the good accuracy for other fluids measured by this group (e. Wilson and Basu2\u00b0), only this latter data set were used in fitting Equation (1). Further measurements on this fluid will be required to ascertain whether this was the proper choice. For liquid density, the situation is considerably better. The available data sources are in good agreement, as shown in Figure 8(b). The saturated liquid densities reported by Kubota et al. ~ were obtained by extrapolating compressed liquid measurements to the saturation pressure. The stated accuracy of the density measurements is 0.09% with the extrapolation adding a perhaps comparable uncertainty. The point at 323.2 K (122.1\u00b0F) appeared to be an outlier and was excluded from the fit. Saturated liquid densities from 216 to 391 K ( -7 1 to 244\u00b0F) were determined by Basu et al. 5~ using their calibrated glass flotation beads. Bender et al. ~ have experimentally measured the heat capacity of R 124 at pressures from 100 to 1500 k Pa (15 to 218 psia) with the ideal gas values obtained by extrapolation to zero pressure. The values reported by Rodgers 31 are coml~uted from apparently limited structural and spectroscopic data. These two sources agree at roughly 375K (215\u00b0F) but diverge at higher temperatures.

Additional sources are Cherneeva ~ and Riedel ~ . The critical temperature and density of Mears et al. 23 were selected for this work. The critical pressure was obtained by extrapolating the vapour pressure data of Cherneeva 57 to the critical temperature. The freezing temperature reported by ASHRAE 27 is adopted here. The vapour pressure data of Riede155, Mears et al. 23 and Cherneeva 57 are fairly consistent, although there is considerable scatter, especially for the latter two sources, as shown in Figure 9(a). The data of Cherneeva 5~ extended over a wider temperature range and gave a slightly better fit to Equation (1) and were thus selected over the data of Mears et al. 2~. The data of Riedel ~8 were also used in the correlation.
